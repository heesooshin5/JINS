# JINS
JAX Integrated Navier-Stokes equation solver

## Introduction
This project utilizes Google-developed JAX (https://github.com/google/jax) for solving direct numerical simulation (DNS) problems using Python. The code development was greatly assisted by Professor Lorena A. Barba's group's "CFD Python" (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython?tab=License-1-ov-file). This project is still in the initial stages, and many additions are planned for the future.
 
## Numerical methods
This project has adopted the following numerical methodologies to solve the Navier-Stokes equations:
1. For time marching, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used.
2. For solving the pressure Poisson equation, an iterative method is used, and the solution is considered found when the values converge within the error range set by the user.

## Examples
1. **Lid cavity problem**:
   The "lid-driven cavity" problem is a classic benchmark in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) used to test and validate numerical methods and software. It involves simulating the flow of a fluid inside a square or rectangular cavity where the top boundary (the "lid") moves at a constant speed while the other boundaries remain stationary. This setup creates complex flow patterns, such as vortices, within the cavity due to the shear forces generated by the moving lid. This problem is particularly useful because it has a simple geometry that is easy to model, yet it exhibits fluid dynamics behaviors that are challenging to compute accurately, such as separation and reattachment of the flow. The results can be used to verify the accuracy and stability of various numerical methods and algorithms in CFD by comparing them with established benchmarks or experimental data.
